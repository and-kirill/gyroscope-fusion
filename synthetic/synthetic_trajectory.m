% Generate synthetic 3D trajectory and generate all characteristics for
% further measurements:
% - body frame acceleration (including gravity)
% - intertial frame angular velocity
% - true orientation
% - Magnetic field in body-referenced frame

%% Synthetic trajectory generation
% Synthetic trajectory s represented by several points in 3D space.
